# Lecture-Databases
Lecture starter and solution code for database lectures

# Setup
Install dependencies and create starter and solution databases
```bash
bun install
cp .env.template .env
touch starter/myDB.sqlite
touch solution/solutionDB.sqlite
```

This will create a starter and solution database in the `starter` and `solution` directories respectively.

All scripts in the package.json have either a `starter` or `solution` suffix to indicate which database they are running on.
